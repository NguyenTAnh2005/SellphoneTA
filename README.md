## 📌 Project Overview

This project simulates a simple used phone selling website.

The goal was to:

- Practice layout building using Bootstrap
- Improve JavaScript logic handling
- Separate UI generation logic into reusable functions
- Understand how dynamic rendering works without frameworks

Instead of using a frontend framework, all dynamic content was generated using plain JavaScript.

## 🚀 Key Features

- Product listing interface
- Bootstrap-based responsive layout
- Dynamic rendering using JavaScript
- Custom functions returning HTML strings based on object data
- Basic UI component structure without framework support

---

## 🧠 Technical Approach

- UI built with HTML + Bootstrap
- JavaScript functions designed to:
  - Receive a product object
  - Return an HTML string
  - Inject content into the DOM

This approach helped simulate component-based rendering before learning React.
